#### Exam Brief
##### Introduction to Data Science Practical Exam

In normal times, a practical exam would be taken in person and students would be given 2hrs to complete the given task. However, due to COVID-19 and blended learning, you are given no time limit and a single submission (as with the winter exams). However, this should give you a guide to how much time spend on the task.

You are given the dataset of Hourly London Air Quality over 2020 for 4 locations in separate borough which should be the main focus of your work. I have also provided two additional datasets of hourly wage and ethnic makeup by boroughs that may optionally included to support air quality insights.

Your brief is to create Jupyter Notebook that provides some insightful summary of the contents of the data set using the methods covered in the unit including (but not necessarily all of)
    

    Loading, formatting and scaling data
    Making new features
    Summarising variables (means, distributions, data types)
    Plotting data
    Segregating/Filtering data
    Investigating the relationships between variables
    Building predictive models

Including a summary of the data, you could then consider one or more of the following*
(*examples are provided as guide and are about Burritos, investigate anything you think may be interesting about the given dataset!)

    Are there are notable differences between categories?
     e.g. Chicken burritos tend to be the widest and the California tacos are most likely to come with free chips

**Can you model you use one or more variables to predict another, or demonstrate a relationship between two or more variables?**
e.g. There is no relationship between cost and flavour synergy, but there is between overall taste and

 **Can you build a model that predicts a categorical class for a new example?**
 *Remember, continuous  variables can be made categorical through thresholding
 e.g. We can train a model to predict whether a tacos overall score will be over 3 to 80.5% accuracy using these features

 **Does the data cluster into recognisable groups without the need for labels?**
 e.g. After clustering the tacos in 5 groups based on taste scores, I found 3 of the clusters had clear characteristics described asâ€¦.

 **Can you identify any trends over time (if date information is available?)**
